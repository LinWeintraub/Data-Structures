# Data-Structures
This repository contains various data structures implemented in C. Each data structure has its own directory with the implementation files.

## List of Data Structures
* **avl:** AVL Tree implementation
* **bit_array:** Bit Array implementation
* **bst:** Binary Search Tree implementation
* **circular_buffer:** Circular Buffer implementation
* **dll:** Doubly Linked List implementation
* **hash_table:** Hash Table implementation
* **heap:** Heap implementation
* **pq_heap:** Priority Queue using Heap implementation
* **priority_queue:** Priority Queue implementation
* **queue:** Queue implementation
* **sll:** Singly Linked List implementation
* **sorted_list:** Sorted List implementation
* **stack:** Stack implementation
* **trie:** Trie implementation
* **vector:** Vector implementation

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
* **Source Files:** These files contain the implementation of the corresponding data structure. They are responsible for defining the functions and logic of the data structure.
* **Header File:** The header file declares the interface and function prototypes for the data structure. It provides the necessary declarations and definitions that other parts of the program can use to interact with the data structure.
* **Test File:** The test file contains unit tests for the data structure. It is used to verify the correctness of the implementation by testing various functionalities and edge cases.

# Usage
To use any of the data structures, follow these steps:

1. Include the corresponding header file in your C program.
2. Link the relevant source file(s) with your program.
3. Build and compile your program.

# Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find any issues or want to improve the existing implementations, feel free to open a pull request.
